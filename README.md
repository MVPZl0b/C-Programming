### Homework Assignment 4
* This assignment was to demonstrate our ability to use pointers and structs, to create a database of dragracers. The bare minimum requirements were as follows:
```
-Code a function menu with the following options:

--1-Add Drag Racer

--2-Display all Drag Racers

--3-search for a Drag Racer by ID

--4-Quit program

-Code a function that input data for a given drag racer.

-Code a function that checks the engine horsepower for a given Drag Racer  
  and determines (true/false) if an engine is to have a supercharger installed or not. Any engine with less than 200 HP
  and with a size larger than 3 liters must have a super charger installed. This function should only set the status to true or 
  false and not display any feedback. The actual recommendation should be handled by the display function

-Code a function that displays the report for a single Drag Racer 
  and related recommendation based on its status (Supercharger to be installed or not)

-Back in main, code the necessary routines based on the user option from the menu.

-Do not allow option 2 and 3 to be active if no engine was input.

-Add a validation function for each of the input (ID, make, Size, HP)
```
* Extra credit that I completed on this assignment:
```
a-Code a function that determines the number of Drag Racers whose engines  are selected to have a superharger installed.

b-Code a function that determines the Drag Racer with an engine with the least and the engine with the most horsepower 
  regardless of size. One SINGLE function needed for this purpose

-c-Code a single report function for ‘a’ and ‘b’
```
